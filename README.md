### Legal Contracts

For testing, we needed legal contracts. But, we did not want to provide any of our personal legal contracts for obvious reasons. So we tried to find datasets containing legal contracts that we could use but that was not easy either. So, by the end of it, we just Google search pdfs of legal contracts and found these:

- https://dlg.ky.gov/DLG%20Documents/Legally%20Binding%20Agreement%20(Attachment%2011-03).pdf
- https://assets.super.so/175a15eb-e555-4078-9949-a94a9e3cad74/files/30278d46-046a-4870-a594-a5e5fc849538/Stripe_Atlas_Consulting_Agreement_Entity_Consultant_(CA)_-_FORM.docx
- https://assets.super.so/175a15eb-e555-4078-9949-a94a9e3cad74/files/c1c9e3ac-26e0-46df-b0e3-bb5575ac7dc9/Stripe_Atlas_Mutual_Nondisclosure_Agreement_-_FORM.docx

These contracts are publically on the internet, literally anyone can Google them, so we think they are fine to use. Also they are great contracts for really testing parts of this project.
