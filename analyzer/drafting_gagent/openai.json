Consultant represents and warrants that Consultant has not granted\nand will not grant any rights or licenses to any intellectual property or technology that would\nconflict with Consultant\u2019s obligations under this Agreement. Consultant will not infringe upon\nany copyright, patent, trade secret or other property right of any former client or third party in the\nperformance of the Services. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that Consultant has listed on\nExhibit\u00a0F all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers\nagreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions\nagreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client or any other person or entity, that may\nrestrict Consultant\u2019s ability to perform services for the Company or Consultant\u2019s ability to recruit\nor engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or\nrestrict Consultant\u2019s ability to perform Consultant\u2019s duties for the Company or any obligation\nConsultant may have to the Company. Consultant shall not enter into any written or oral\nagreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.\n16.\nMiscellaneous.\n(a)\nGoverning Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and\nperformance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and\nobligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with\nthe laws of the state of ______________, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.\n(b)\nEntire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and\nunderstanding of the parties relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior or\ncontemporaneous discussions, understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between\nthem relating to the subject matter hereof.\n(c)\nAmendments and Waivers. No modification of or amendment to this\nAgreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, shall be effective unless in\nwriting signed by the parties to this Agreement. No delay or failure to require performance of\nany provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that provision as to that or any other\ninstance.\n-9-\n(d)\nSuccessors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided in this\nAgreement, this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, will be\nbinding upon and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors,\nadministrators and legal representatives. The Company may assign any of its rights and\nobligations under this Agreement. No other party to this Agreement may assign, whether\nvoluntarily or by operation of law, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, except\nwith the prior written consent of the Company.\n(e)\nNotices. Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given\nunder this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered\npersonally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S.\nmail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at\nsuch party\u2019s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written\nnotice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in\nthe Company\u2019s books and records.\n(f)\nSeverability. If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are\ndeemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be\nenforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force\nof the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The Company and Consultant have\nattempted to limit Consultant\u2019s right to use, maintain and disclose the Company\u2019s Confidential\nInformation, and to limit Consultant\u2019s right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent\nnecessary to protect the Company from unfair competition. Should a court of competent\njurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section\u00a08 exceeds the\nmaximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the\ncourt should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to\nbe reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time. In the event that\nany court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the\nterms of this Agreement specifying Consultant\u2019s Relationship with the Company as that of an\nindependent contractor, Consultant\u2019s provision of Services to the Company is not as an\nindependent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the\nextent that such determination is applicable, references in this Agreement to the Relationship\nbetween Consultant and the Company shall be interpreted to include an employment\nrelationship, and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the\nfullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent\nand purpose of this Agreement.\n(g)\nRemedies. Consultant acknowledges that violation of this Agreement by\nConsultant may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore that the Company will be\nentitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining\norders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a\nbond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, that a $1,000 bond will be\nadequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company\nmay have for a breach of this Agreement.\n-10-\n(h)\nFacilitation of Agreement. Consultant agrees to execute promptly, both\nduring and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document,\nrequired to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company\u2019s written request to do so.\n(i)\nConstruction. This Agreement is the result of negotiations between and\nhas been reviewed by each of the parties hereto and their respective counsel, if any; accordingly,\nthis Agreement shall be deemed to be the product of all of the parties hereto, and no ambiguity\nshall be construed in favor of or against any one of the parties hereto.\n(j)\nCounterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of\ncounterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all\nof which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Execution of a facsimile or\nscanned copy will have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile or\nscanned signature will be deemed an original and valid signature.\n(k)\nElectronic Delivery. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to\ndeliver any documents related to this Agreement or any notices required by applicable law or the\nCompany\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws by email or any other electronic means.\nConsultant hereby consents to (i) conduct business electronically (ii) receive such documents and\nnotices by such electronic delivery and (iii) sign documents electronically and agrees to\nparticipate through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company\nor a third party designated by the Company.\n[Signature Page Follows]\n-11-\nThe parties have executed this Agreement on the respective dates set forth below, to be\neffective as of the Effective Date first above written.\nTHE COMPANY:\n[COMPANY NAME]\nBy:\n(Signature)\nName:\nTitle:\nAddress:\n____________________\n__________ ______\nUnited States\nDate:\nCONSULTANT:\n(PRINT NAME)\nBy:\n(Signature)\nName:\nTitle:\nAddress:\nEmail:\nDate:\n-12-\nEXHIBIT\u00a0A\nDESCRIPTION OF CONSULTING SERVICES\nDescription of Services\nSchedule/Deadline\n1.\n2.\nIWOVFOOTER1\nEXHIBIT\u00a0B\nCOMPENSATION\nCheck applicable payment terms:\n[ ]\nFor Services rendered by Consultant under this Agreement, the Company shall pay\nConsultant at the rate of $____ per hour, payable _______________.

      "You waive any liability claims against Orrick, Stripe, and their affiliates related to your use of the forms.",
      "If you use the Consulting Agreement template, you commit to maintaining confidentiality, assigning intellectual property rights to the company, and following the outlined terms regarding payment, termination, and independent contractor status."
    ],
    "important_risks": [
      "No legal advice or representation is provided through these documents, and misunderstandings can lead to legal trouble if you rely solely on the forms without consulting an attorney.",
      "You are taking on the risk of being liable for any misuse or inaccurate use of the forms, including non-compliance with securities or employment laws.",
      "There is a broad limitation of liability protecting Orrick and Stripe; you are waiving many rights to claim damages against them.",
      "Consulting Agreement clauses on intellectual property assignment are broad, meaning you could lose ownership of or rights to inventions created while performing consulting work.",
      "Consultants can be exposed to indemnification obligations if their actions harm the company\u2019s interests or if they breach confidentiality or intellectual property provisions."
    ],
    "plain_english_summary": "These Terms & Conditions clarify that Orrick\u2019s Start-Up Forms (accessed via Stripe Atlas) are informational templates, not legal advice. Orrick and Stripe are not your lawyers or agents, and there is no attorney-client relationship. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of these forms complies with all laws. Orrick, Stripe, and their affiliates will not be liable for how you use these forms, or for any damages that result. If you use the Consulting Agreement, it sets the terms of a contractor relationship with a company. It outlines payment, expenses, intellectual property ownership, confidentiality duties, and indemnification responsibilities. You must also respect non-solicitation and non-disclosure provisions, and the company can terminate the agreement if you breach its terms. If you want to modify any of the consulting terms, you or your lawyer should carefully review the language, because the document heavily favors the company\u2019s ownership and protection of confidential information. Overall, you should read critically, consult legal or business advisors, and ensure you understand your obligations and limitations before signing.",

      "The broad waiver of liability, where the user waives claims against Orrick, Stripe, and affiliates, is more expansive than many standard disclaimers.",
      "The requirement to indemnify and hold harmless Orrick and Stripe for most claims can be significant, especially if using these forms results in legal action by third parties.",
      "Very strong intellectual property assignment clauses in the Consulting Agreement: anything created by the consultant for the company is owned by the company, including potential moral rights waivers.",

      "No Attorney-Client Relationship": "States that using these forms does not create a legal relationship with Orrick, so you cannot claim confidentiality or conflict protection from them.",
      "Compliance with Laws": "You must follow all relevant regulations. Orrick and Stripe are not responsible if you break laws using the templates.",
      "Disclaimer of Liability": "Orrick and Stripe provide the materials 'as is' without warranties, shifting the risk to you for any negative outcomes.",
      "Use by Agents": "If someone uses the forms on your behalf (e.g., your employee or lawyer), you are still fully bound by the terms.",
      "Ownership of Inventions": "If you use the Consulting Agreement, the hiring company generally owns all intellectual property created by the consultant in the course of work.",
      "Indemnification": "You agree to cover Orrick, Stripe, and their affiliates for any legal or financial fallout if you do not comply with the applicable laws or if your use of the forms leads to a dispute or claim.",
      "Limitations of Liability": "Extensively protects Orrick and Stripe by capping their liability and clarifying you cannot seek indirect or special damages from them.",
      "Independent Contractor Status": "Clarifies that the consultant is not an employee, meaning no typical employee benefits or protections apply.",
      "Termination": "Either party can usually end the consulting relationship, but certain obligations (like confidentiality) continue after termination.",
